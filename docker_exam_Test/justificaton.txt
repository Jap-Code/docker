Hello and thank you very much for reviewing my exam. I hope you are fine!

you can start the whole test sequence by executing the 'execute.sh'. After waiting for the uvicorn startup,
container1 ist running its test. The credentials are taken from the users.json file. Every Name: Password 
combination which returns 200 is added to a 'authenticated.json' file. All others are out of the next tests. 

Container2 waits for container1 to finish its service, and then works through the authorisation tests. It 
does this with the content auf the 'authenticated.json' file. Every user who is authorised for both 
versions (v1 and v2) is added to a 'authorised.json' file. 

Container3 ist waiting for container2 to finish its service and then takes the contents of the 
'authorised.json' file and takes the sentences from the 'sentences.json' file to work for each
sentence the test on v1 and v2.

Every test result is logged in the 'api_test.log' file in folder /logs - the volume all three containers share
for the files to be persitent. In this volume the created json files can be found too. My goal was to have a 
fully automated test chain which can be executed by a simple "docker-compose up" (maybe later replaced by a github-actions 
trigger if i got that right).

The only thing i haven't figured out yet was to boil down the three dockerfiles for the containers to one. 
I tried but the added ARGS in the docker-compose file didn't make it into the containers.. so i still have to 
figure this one out.
